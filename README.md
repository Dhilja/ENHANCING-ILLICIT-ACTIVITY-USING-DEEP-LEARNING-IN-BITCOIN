This drive contains all the files needed to execute the project.

DATASET CREATION 

Project(1).ipynb file contains the code needed to construct the dataset, garph and the edge index and the feature matrix. 

GRL MODELS

GCN.ipynb , GIN.ipynb, GraphSAGE.ipynb, GrahTransformer.ipynb, Another copy of GAT2.ipynb contains the code for the models GCN,gin, GraphSAGE , GraphTransfromer and GAT respectively.

70:15:15 DATASET SPLIT OF GAT IS PLACED IN GAT_70.IPYNB
90:5:5 DATASET SPLIT OF GAT IS PLACED IN GAT_90.IPYNB

parameter sensitivity.ipynb

It contains the anlysis of the models.



All the datasets are stored in drive , you may need to change the file path respectively.
